# Slowly-Letter-Download
Download letters from your Slowly Pen-Pals in a nice unified book with all the names, images and timestamps attached!
If you want to change the styles, simply change them in the template doc file attached and run the script afterwards.

The script runs though all your letters with your friend in Slowly using Chrome and web version of the Slowly. 
Just run the script or run the exectubale! (Just make sure you have a template doc file in the same folder!)

How to run:
Script: download all the necessaray libraries included in the top of the script, run the script, press ENTER when you logged in and opened the chat with your Pen-Pal!
Executable: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ikfOQK7k3M0M35MtlvZZnduwcCGTMAf/view?usp=sharing
Download the archive, unpack it, run it. Log in, and then press the ENTER twice in the program screen.

Possible issues:
Chrome version error: just enable the code line next to the driver in the script. Change the number in ' ' to the one your Chrome version has, or simply wait for a day/two.
Click error: it couldn't click on the letter due to the button 'Write a letter'. Simply resize the screen as you run the script.
